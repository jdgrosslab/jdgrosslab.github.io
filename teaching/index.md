## Biophysics 204: Macromolecular Methods
Fluency in multiple biophysical methods is often critical for answering mechanistic questions. To train the next generation of biophysicists at UCSF, we have decided to alter the traditional didactic structure by creating a new 6 week “Macromolecular Methods” class that places data collection at the beginning of the course.
