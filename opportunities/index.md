### Postdoctoral Positions

##### <a class="cyan-text lighten-1">Position to study the regulation of enzymes in biological condensates </a>
A post-doctoral position is available to study how molecular composition affects rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in biological condensates.  Questions of ongoing interest are: 1-how does liquid-liquid phase separation repress enzyme activity, contrary to popular models of local concentration effects? 2- how do intrinsically disordered regions and their binding proteins re-wire condensates from a repressed to an active state? 3-how does the transfer of short linear interaction motifs during evolution impact condensate function? 4-how are interactions that mediate condensate material properties on the mesoscale coupled to enzyme active site geometry at the Angstrom scale?  The resolution of these questions will be enabled by tools and approaches we recently described for studies of the decapping enzyme complex,  which can be applied to a variety of systems in RNA biology, including viral replication clusters (Tibble et al, Nat Chem Biol, 2021).   Candidates should have or expect a Ph.D. and should have demonstrated achievements in the biophysics of proteins and RNA. Expertise using NMR spectroscopy or related approaches to study the structure and dynamics of proteins or RNA is highly desirable.  

Applications materials, including CV and contact information for three references, should be sent to:
