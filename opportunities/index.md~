### Postdoctoral Positions
<br>
##### <a class="cyan-text lighten-1">Position in host-virus interactions </a>

We seek to understand the structural basis of how viruses suppress host innate immunity and how these interactions change over evolutionary time. Systems of interest include pox viruses and primate lentiviruses such as HIV. Applicants will have expertise in heterologous protein expression in eukaryotic cells, protein purification and either X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. Our lab is part of the NIH funded **[HARC center] (https://harc.ucsf.edu/)** and the **[UCSF Macromolecular Structure Group] (http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/)**. The opportunity to integrate evolutionary analysis with structure, biochemistry, and molecular virology is strong.

Applications materials, including CV and contact information for three references should be sent to:

with “post-doc position” written in subject line.
