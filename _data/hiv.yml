    Vif hijacks a ubiquitin E3 ligase to antagonize APOBEC3 family members. We have recently determined a 2.8 Angstrom resolution cryoEM structure of human APOBEC3G bound to HIV-1 Vif.  Unexpectedly, we discovered an RNA molecule acts as a molecular glue for the Vif-A3G interaction. An essential step for retroviral restriction is binding to genomic RNA for encapsidation, so that APOBEC3 can be near cDNA as it emerges from the reverse transcription complex.  We hypothesize that HIV-1 Vif antagonizes APOBEC3G in its most dangerous form for the virus.
