- title: Control of mRNA stability by the mRNA decapping complex
  
  body: |
    The regulated destruction of mRNA transcripts plays an important role in controlling cellular gene expression. A critcal step in the 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway is removal of the protective 5' cap by the dynamic, multiprotein decapping complex, which commits the transcript to rapid degradation. Our lab is developing a structural-level understanding of how the decapping complex catalyzes mRNA cap cleavage and how decapping activity is activated and regulated by protein-protein interactions to control mRNA stability.

- title: Structural biology of HIV-host protein complexes
  
  body: |
    Many viral pathogens co-evolve with host organisms to persist in spite of host immune defenses. As part of the HARC Center at UCSF, our lab is studying how viral HIV proteins interact with human host proteins to cause infection and disease. We are deconstructing the intermolecular interactions between viral immunomodulatory proteins and host proteins at the molecular level to improve our understanding of both host immunity and viral pathogenesis, and to aid in the development of new classes of antiviral therapeutics.

- title: Nucleosome dynamics 
  
  body: |
    Chromatin remodeling motors use the energy of ATP to alter nucleosome positions, conformation and composition and thereby regulate how the genome is packaged and acted on. Yet compared to other essential motors such as myosins and helicases, the biochemical mechanisms of chromatin remodelers are poorly understood. In collaboration with the Narlikar lab we are exploring the dynamics and conformational changes of the nucleosome core particle to understand how chromatin remodeling proteins affect nucleosome structure and dynamics to control gene expression.
