- title: Control of mRNA stability by the mRNA decapping complex
  
  body: |
    The regulated destruction of mRNA transcripts plays an important role in controlling cellular gene expression. A critcal step in the 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway is removal of the protective 5' cap by the dynamic, multiprotein decapping complex, which commits the transcript to rapid degradation. Our lab is developing a structural-level understanding of how the decapping complex catalyzes mRNA cap cleavage and how decapping activity is activated and regulated by protein-protein interactions to control mRNA stability. **[Learn more](decapping)**

- title: Host-pathogen conflicts
  
  body: |
    We are interested in how viruses suppress innate immunity and how hosts escape suppression during evolution. By combining biochemistry, structural biophysics and viral genetics we seek to bridge the gap between how subtle changes in primary sequence effect protein interactions that determine whether host or virus survives.  This work is significant because it could inform upon antiviral therapies and explain how viruses cross species giving rise to pandemics such as AIDS.

- title: Nucleosome dynamics 
  
  body: |
    Chromatin remodeling motors use the energy of ATP to alter nucleosome positions, conformation and composition and thereby regulate how the genome is packaged and acted on. Yet compared to other essential motors such as myosins and helicases, the biochemical mechanisms of chromatin remodelers are poorly understood. In collaboration with the Narlikar lab we are exploring the dynamics and conformational changes of the nucleosome core particle to understand how chromatin remodeling proteins affect nucleosome structure and dynamics to control gene expression. **[Learn more](chromatin)**
