    Regulation by the integrated stress response (ISR) converges on the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to a variety of stresses. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate to a competitive inhibitor of its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, thereby inhibiting translation. ISRIB, a drug-like eIF2B activator, reverses the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation, and in rodents it enhances cognition and corrects cognitive deficits after brain injury. To determine its mechanism of action, we solved an atomic-resolution structure of ISRIB bound in a deep cleft within decameric human eIF2B by cryo–electron microscopy. Formation of fully active, decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric subcomplexes, and ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry interface. Thus, regulation of eIF2B assembly emerges as a rheostat for eIF2B activity that tunes translation during the ISR and that can be further modulated by ISRIB.

    Dynamin, which mediates membrane fission during endocytosis, binds endophilin and other members of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) protein family. How endophilin influences endocytic membrane fission is still unclear. Here we show that dynamin-mediated membrane fission is potently inhibited in vitro when an excess of endophilin co-assembles with dynamin around membrane tubules. We further show by electron microscopy that endophilin intercalates between turns of the dynamin helix and impairs fission by preventing trans interactions between dynamin rungs that are thought to play critical roles in membrane constriction. In living cells, overexpression of endophilin delayed both fission and transferrin uptake. Together, our observations suggest that while endophilin helps shape endocytic tubules and recruit dynamin to endocytic sites, it can also block membrane fission when present in excess by inhibiting inter-dynamin interactions. The sequence of recruitment and the relative stoichiometry of the two proteins may be critical to regulated endocytic fission.

    Ribosomes can stall during translation due to defects in the mRNA template or translation machinery, leading to the production of incomplete proteins. The Ribosome-associated Quality control Complex (RQC) engages stalled ribosomes and targets nascent polypeptides for proteasomal degradation. However, how each RQC component contributes to this process remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that key RQC activities-Ltn1p-dependent ubiquitination and Rqc2p-mediated Carboxy-terminal Alanine and Threonine (CAT) tail elongation-can be recapitulated in vitro with a yeast cell-free system. Using this approach, we determined that CAT tailing is mechanistically distinct from canonical translation, that Ltn1p-mediated ubiquitination depends on the poorly characterized RQC component Rqc1p, and that the process of CAT tailing enables robust ubiquitination of the nascent polypeptide. These findings establish a novel system to study the RQC and provide a framework for understanding how RQC factors coordinate their activities to facilitate clearance of incompletely synthesized proteins.

  journal:  __SCIENCE__ 2017 Jul
  abstract: |
    Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized polypeptide for proteasomal degradation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent polypeptide by adding a carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction. Here we examined the role of CAT-tailing in nascent-chain degradation in budding yeast. We found that Ltn1p efficiently accessed only nascent-chain lysines immediately proximal to the ribosome exit tunnel. For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible lysines, CAT-tailing enabled degradation by exposing lysines sequestered in the ribosome exit tunnel. Thus, CAT-tails do not serve as a degron, but rather provide a fail-safe mechanism that expands the range of RQC-degradable substrates.

  abstract: |
    Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport III (ESCRT-III) proteins have been implicated in sealing the nuclear envelope in mammals, spindle pole body dynamics in fission yeast, and surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast. Here, we report that Lem2p (LEM2), a member of the LEM (Lap2-Emerin-Man1) family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein Cmp7p (CHMP7), work together to recruit additional ESCRT-III proteins to holes in the nuclear membrane. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, deletion of the ATPase vps4 leads to severe defects in nuclear morphology and integrity. These phenotypes are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations that arise spontaneously in lem2 or cmp7, implying that these proteins may function upstream in the same pathway. Building on these genetic interactions, we explored the role of LEM2 during nuclear envelope reformation in human cells. We found that CHMP7 and LEM2 enrich at the same region of the chromatin disk periphery during this window of cell division and that CHMP7 can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of LEM2 in vitro. We further found that, during nuclear envelope formation, recruitment of the ESCRT factors CHMP7, CHMP2A, and IST1/CHMP8 all depend on LEM2 in human cells. We conclude that Lem2p/LEM2 is a conserved nuclear site-specific adaptor that recruits Cmp7p/CHMP7 and downstream ESCRT factors to the nuclear envelope.

    The large GTPase dynamin is the first protein shown to catalyze membrane fission. Dynamin and its related proteins are essential to many cell functions, from endocytosis to organelle division and fusion, and it plays a critical role in many physiological functions such as synaptic transmission and muscle contraction. Research of the past three decades has focused on understanding how dynamin works. In this review, we present the basis for an emerging consensus on how dynamin functions. Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. We present the two current models for fission, essentially diverging in how GTP energy is spent. We further discuss how future research might solve the remaining open questions presently under discussion.

  abstract: |
    Hypoxic growth of fungi requires sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, and human opportunistic fungal pathogens require SREBP activation for virulence. Proteolytic release of fission yeast SREBPs from the membrane in response to low oxygen requires the Golgi membrane-anchored Dsc E3 ligase complex. Using genetic interaction arrays, we identified Rbd2 as a rhomboid family protease required for SREBP proteolytic processing. Rbd2 is an active, Golgi-localized protease that cleaves the transmembrane segment of the TatA rhomboid model substrate. Epistasis analysis revealed that the Dsc E3 ligase acts on SREBP prior to cleavage by Rbd2. Using APEX2 proximity biotinylation, we demonstrated that Rbd2 binds the AAA-ATPase Cdc48 through a C-terminal SHP box. Interestingly, SREBP cleavage required Rbd2 binding of Cdc48, consistent with Cdc48 acting to recruit ubiquitinylated substrates. In support of this claim, overexpressing a Cdc48-binding mutant of Rbd2 bypassed the Cdc48 requirement for SREBP cleavage, demonstrating that Cdc48 likely plays a role in SREBP recognition. In the absence of functional Rbd2, SREBP precursor is degraded by the proteasome, indicating that Rbd2 activity controls the balance between SREBP activation and degradation.

    The exocyst is a hetero-octameric complex that has been proposed to serve 
    as the tethering complex for exocytosis, although it remains poorly 
    understood at the molecular level. Here, we purified endogenous exocyst 
    complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed that they are stable 
    and consist of all eight subunits with equal stoichiometry. Using a 
    combination of biochemical and auxin induced-degradation experiments in 
    yeast, we mapped the subunit connectivity, identified two stable four-
    subunit modules within the octamer and demonstrated that several known 
    exocyst-binding partners are not necessary for exocyst assembly and 
    stability. Furthermore, we visualized the structure of the yeast complex 
    by using negative-stain electron microscopy; our results indicate that the 
    exocyst exists predominantly as a stable, octameric complex with an 
    elongated architecture that suggests that the subunits are contiguous 
    helical bundles packed together into a bundle of long rods.

    The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins 
    mediate fundamental membrane remodeling events that require stabilizing 
    negative membrane curvature. These include endosomal intralumenal vesicle 
    formation, HIV budding, nuclear envelope closure, and cytokinetic 
    abscission. ESCRT-III subunits perform key roles in these processes by 
    changing conformation and polymerizing into membrane-remodeling filaments. 
    Here, we report the 4 angstrom resolution cryogenic electron microscopy 
    reconstruction of a one-start, double-stranded helical copolymer composed 
    of two different human ESCRT-III subunits, charged multivesicular body 
    protein 1B (CHMP1B) and increased sodium tolerance 1 (IST1). The inner 
    strand comprises "open" CHMP1B subunits that interlock in an elaborate 
    domain-swapped architecture and is encircled by an outer strand of 
    "closed" IST1 subunits. Unlike other ESCRT-III proteins, CHMP1B and IST1 
    polymers form external coats on positively curved membranes in vitro and 
    in vivo. Our analysis suggests how common ESCRT-III filament architectures 
    could stabilize different degrees and directions of membrane curvature.

    In Eukarya, stalled translation induces 40S dissociation and recruitment 
    of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) to the 60S subunit, which 
    mediates nascent chain degradation. Here we report cryo-electron 
    microscopy structures revealing that the RQC components Rqc2p (YPL009C/
    Tae2) and Ltn1p (YMR247C/Rkr1) bind to the 60S subunit at sites exposed 
    after 40S dissociation, placing the Ltn1p RING (Really Interesting New 
    Gene) domain near the exit channel and Rqc2p over the P-site transfer RNA (
    tRNA). We further demonstrate that Rqc2p recruits alanine- and threonine-
    charged tRNA to the A site and directs the elongation of nascent chains 
    independently of mRNA or 40S subunits. Our work uncovers an unexpected 
    mechanism of protein synthesis, in which a protein--not an 
    mRNA--determines tRNA recruitment and the tagging of nascent chains with 
    carboxy-terminal Ala and Thr extensions (\"CAT tails\").

  abstract: |
    Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the dynamin-related GTPases Dnm1/Drp1 
    (yeast/mammals), which form spirals around constricted sites on 
    mitochondria. Additional membrane-associated adaptor proteins (Fis1, Mdv1, 
    Mff, and MiDs) are required to recruit these GTPases from the cytoplasm to 
    the mitochondrial surface. Whether these adaptors participate in both 
    GTPase recruitment and membrane scission is not known. Here we use a yeast 
    strain lacking all fission proteins to identify the minimal combinations 
    of GTPases and adaptors sufficient for mitochondrial fission. Although 
    Fis1 is dispensable for fission, membrane-anchored Mdv1, Mff, or MiDs 
    paired individually with their respective GTPases are sufficient to divide 
    mitochondria. In addition to their role in Drp1 membrane recruitment, MiDs 
    coassemble with Drp1 in vitro. The resulting heteropolymer adopts a 
    dramatically different structure with a narrower diameter than Drp1 
    homopolymers assembled in isolation. This result demonstrates that an 
    adaptor protein alters the architecture of a mitochondrial dynamin GTPase 
    polymer in a manner that could facilitate membrane constriction and 
    severing activity.

    The conserved transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) is a

    surveyed Hsf1 activity in a genome-wide loss-of-function library in 
    Saccaromyces cerevisiae as well as ~78,000 double mutants and found Hsf1 
    activity to be modulated by highly diverse stresses. These included 
    disruption of a ribosome-bound complex we named the Ribosome Quality 
    Control Complex (RQC) comprising the Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, two highly 
    conserved but poorly characterized proteins (Tae2 and Rqc1), and Cdc48 and 
    its cofactors. Electron microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that 
    the RQC forms a stable complex with 60S ribosomal subunits containing 
    stalled polypeptides and triggers their degradation. A negative feedback 
    loop regulates the RQC, and Hsf1 senses an RQC-mediated translation-stress 
    signal distinctly from other stresses. Our work reveals the range of 
    stresses Hsf1 monitors and elucidates a conserved cotranslational protein

  abstract: |
    Functioning as key players in cellular regulation of membrane curvature, 
    BAR domain proteins bend bilayers and recruit interaction partners through 
    poorly understood mechanisms. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we present 
    reconstructions of full-length endophilin and its N-terminal N-BAR domain 
    in their membrane-bound state. Endophilin lattices expose large areas of 
    membrane surface and are held together by promiscuous interactions between 
    endophilin's amphipathic N-terminal helices. Coarse-grained molecular 
    dynamics simulations reveal that endophilin lattices are highly dynamic 
    and that the N-terminal helices are required for formation of a stable and 
    regular scaffold. Furthermore, endophilin accommodates different 
    curvatures through a quantized addition or removal of endophilin dimers, 
    which in some cases causes dimerization of endophilin's SH3 domains, 
    suggesting that the spatial presentation of SH3 domains, rather than 
    affinity, governs the recruitment of downstream interaction partners.

  abstract: |
    During brain development, proper neuronal migration and morphogenesis is 
    critical for the establishment of functional neural circuits. Here we 
    report that srGAP2 negatively regulates neuronal migration and induces 
    neurite outgrowth and branching through the ability of its F-BAR domain to 
    induce filopodia-like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by 
    I-BAR domains in vivo and in vitro. Previous work has suggested that in 
    nonneuronal cells filopodia dynamics decrease the rate of cell migration 
    and the persistence of leading edge protrusions. srGAP2 knockdown reduces 
    leading process branching and increases the rate of neuronal migration in 
    vivo. Overexpression of srGAP2 or its F-BAR domain has the opposite 
    effects, increasing leading process branching and decreasing migration. 
    These results suggest that F-BAR domains are functionally diverse and 
    highlight the functional importance of proteins directly regulating 
    membrane deformation for proper neuronal migration and morphogenesis.

  abstract: |
    Membrane-shaping proteins of the BAR domain superfamily are determinants 
    of organelle biogenesis, membrane trafficking, cell division, and cell 
    migration. An upsurge of research now reveals new principles of BAR 
    domain-mediated membrane remodeling, enhancing our understanding of 
    membrane curvature-mediated information processing.

    BAR superfamily domains shape membranes through poorly understood 
    mechanisms. We solved structures of F-BAR modules bound to flat and curved 
    bilayers using electron (cryo)microscopy. We show that membrane tubules 
    form when F-BARs polymerize into helical coats that are held together by 
    lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. On gel-state membranes or after 
    mutation of residues along the lateral interaction surface, F-BARs adsorb 
    onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that 
    membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition 
    of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend 
    locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface 
    through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly 
    of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric 
    constraints and sequential assembly of the helical lattice explain how 
    F-BAR and classical BAR domains segregate into distinct microdomains, and 
    provide insight into the spatial regulation of membrane invagination.

  abstract: |
    Expanding the range of curvature generating and curvature stabilizing 
    protein modules, the first F-BAR domain structures support their 
    assignment to the BAR domain superfamily and emphasize how modifications 
    to a basic structural frame can generate a broad spectrum of properties.

- title: GTP-dependent twisting of dynamin implicates constriction and tension in membrane fission.

  abstract: |
    Dynamin, a crucial factor in endocytosis, is a member of a family of 
    GTPases that participates in membrane fission. It was initially proposed 
    to act as a machine that constricts and cuts the neck of nascent vesicles 
    in a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent reaction, but subsequent studies suggested 
    alternative models. Here we monitored the effect of nucleotides on 
    dynamin-coated lipid tubules in real time. Addition of GTP, but not of GDP 
    or GTP-gammaS, resulted in twisting of the tubules and supercoiling, 
    suggesting a rotatory movement of the helix turns relative to each other 
    during GTP hydrolysis. Rotation was confirmed by the movement of beads 
    attached to the tubules. Twisting activity produced a longitudinal tension 
    that was released by tubule breakage when both ends of the tubule were 
    anchored. Fission also occurred when dynamin and GTP were added to lipid 
    tubules that had been generated from liposomes by the motor activity of 
    kinesin on microtubules. No fission events were observed in the absence of 
    longitudinal tension. These findings demonstrate a mechanoenzyme activity 
    of dynamin in endocytosis, but also imply that constriction is not 
    sufficient for fission. At the short necks of endocytic vesicles, other 
    factors leading to tension may cooperate with the constricting activity of 
    dynamin to induce fission.
